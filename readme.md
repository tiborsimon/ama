Hi, my name is Tibor Simon. I am a graduated electrical engineer with a masters degree. You can find out more about me and my work on my personal website [tiborsimon.io](https://tiborsimon.io). But, you are might here because you have a question for me. This repo is dedicated for questions that you ask about anything about me.

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
